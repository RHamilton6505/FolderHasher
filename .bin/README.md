LINUX INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------------------
No futher tools need to be installed. Change your directory to .bin and run ./hashScript.sh

MACOS INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------------------
SHA512 needs be installed onto MacOS mashines. To do so, a homebrew install exists. Furthermore, the PATH command to run it needs to be aliased as "sha512sum". From here, migrate to the .bin folder and run ./hashScript.sh
